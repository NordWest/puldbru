PUL2 catalog (CDS I/295) </a>
<br><br>
PUL2 catalog contains original absolute proper motions of 59646 stars in 149
fields with galaxies. The catalog was constucted at  Pulkovo
using the results of observations
obtained with the Normal astrograph according to program of construction of
Catalog of faint stars by A.N.Deich's plan. The first epochs were obtained
from 1937 to 1965, the second epochs from 1969 to 1986. The mean difference
of epochs is 24 years. There are not less than 3 plates for each field.
Each plate has 1-hour and 5-minute exposures. One pair of plates has been
exposured with a diffraction grid. The limit photographic magnitude in the
catalog is 17.0. About 700 galaxies were used for absolutisation of relative
proper motions. Mean errors of relative proper motions in PUL2 catalog is 5.5
mas/year. The mean error of absolutisation by galaxies is 7.9 mas/year for
both of coordinates. The external mean error of one relative proper
motion of a bright star of PUL2 catalog is 9 mas/year for both of
coordinates.

Pul-3 catalog (CDS I/290)</a>
<br><br>
A catalogue of positions and proper motions of 58483 stars (Pul-3) has been constructed at the Pulkovo observatory.
The Pul-3 is based on the results of measurements of photographic plates with
galaxies (Deutsch's plan). All plates were taken
using the Pulkovo Normal Astrograph (the first epoch is in the 1950s and the
second epoch is in the 1970s).
The Pul-3 catalogue contains stars of mainly 12 to 16.5 mag in 146 fields
with galaxies in the declination zone from -5
to +85 degrees. The Tycho-2 has been used as a reference catalogue.
The mean epoch of the Pul-3 is 1963.25. The internal positional accuracy
 of the Pul-3 catalogue at the mean epoch of observations
is 80 mas. The accuracy of the proper motions is mostly within 3 mas/yr
to 12 mas/yr. Comparisons of the Pul-3
with Tycho-2 and ARIHIP have been done at the mean epoch of the Pul-3.
The Pul-3 external positional accuracy relative to
Tycho-2 is 150 mas.

<!--
Pul-3 catalog contains precise equatorial coordinates and relative proper
motions of 58483 stars, mostly with magnitude between 12 and 16.5, and with
declination from -5 to 90 degrees in the system of Tycho-2 catalog.
Results of measuring of photographic plates, obtained on the Normal astrograph
during A.N.Deich's program of calculation of absolute proper motions, were the
material for this work. The task of determination of precise equatorial coordinate
was not regarded at that time. Mean epoch of Pul-3 catalog is 1963.35.
Mean value of internal rms error is 80 mas for coordinates and 3-12 mas/year
for proper motions. External errors of coordinates by Tycho-2 are 150 mas for
the mean epoch of Pul-3.<br>
-->

Pul-3 catalog was formed from observation material obtained in two epochs:
1950s and 1970s. Relative proper motions, given in the catalog, were also obtained
from these data. After issue of UCAC2 catalog, we decided to improve accuracy
of proper motions, using Pul-3 coordinates (of 1950s) as the first epoch, and
UCAC2 coordinates as the second epoch. New proper motions were obtained for
34081 stars with declination from -5 to +42 degrees. New proper motions and UCAC2
identificator were added to Pul-3 catalog. So Pul-3 SE catalog was formed.
Internal accuracy of new proper motions is 2-4 mas/year. External accuracy
is 3-5 mas/year. The final version of new proper motions of Pul-3 stars
with declination from -5 to +90 degrees will be issued after completing
of all observations of UCAC project (UCAC3).

<a href="http://www.puldb.ru/pul_ers/pulersc.php" > Pul ERS catalog </a>
<br><br>
Observations of star fields around 73 extragalactic radio sources with
delination from +26 to +90 degrees were performed on Normal astrograph
of Pulkovo observatory from 1992 till 1997. At present time catalogs of stars
in neighborhood of 23  extragalactic radio sources are obtained (23
individual catalogs - Pul ERS). Catalogs contain precise equatorial coordinates
of stars up to 16<sup>m</sup> in ICRS/Tycho system for mean epoch close to
1993.0, and estimates of magnitudes as well. In addition to coordinates
of stars around radio sources, equatorial coordinates of 13 brightest
 extragalactic radio sources were determined. Total number of stars in 23 catalogs
 is 2817, 1647 of them (with magnitude from 13 to 16) are located within 16
arcmin range from  extragalactic radio sources. The goal of this work is
the determination of precise coordinates of faint stars in modern reference system,
which can be used as reference stars for observations of
 extragalactic radio sources on instruments with CCD detectors.
